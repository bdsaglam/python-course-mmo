    "Numpy performance tricks\n",
    "========================\n",
    "I've been using Numpy for nearly five years, but I'm still learning performance tricks. The reason is that I currently need to deal with very large arrays (hundreds of millions of elements) and the performance of my code started to be disappointing. Then, through extensive line-by-line profiling, I discovered some subtleties that explain why some seemingly harmless lines of code can actually lead to major  bottlenecks. Very often, a small trick allows to significantly improve the performance. Here is what I've learnt. These tips are intended to regular Numpy users rather than pure beginners."

    "Know how Numpy works\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For a beginner, learning Numpy's basics is more a matter of days rather than weeks. The notion of multidimensional array is quite intuitive, so is  the notion of computations on vectors and matrices for someone with a mathematics background. Computing an element-wise multiplication of two vectors with `a*b` is actually easier and less error-prone than with a classical imperative programming language where it would require a `for` loop. Yet, when comes the need to do complex computations on multidimensional arrays containing millions of elements, it becomes quite valuable to know a bit about Numpy's internals. I don't know much about it, but what I know sometimes allows me to improve the performance of my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are simplified facts that can be useful to know. Computer memory is basically one-dimensional: bytes are consecutively stored in a one-dimensional memory space and are accessed through memory adresses. A multidimensional Numpy array is stored as a contiguous block of memory, so that two successive elements in the array occupy two successive places in memory. Each element occupies `itemsize` bytes, depending on the **data type** (dtype): 2 for an `int16`, 4 for a `float32` (single precision floating point number), 8 for a `float64 = double` (double precision), etc.  But memory is one-dimensional: how to store a nD array in  a one-dimensional space? The solution lies in the notion of **shape** and **[stride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_of_an_array)**. The shape is a n-tuple with the number of elements in each dimension. The stride is a n-tuple with, for each dimension, the number of bytes (or step) that one needs to jump in memory to go from one element to the next in that dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-dimensional vector, the stride is typically `(itemsize,)`, but for higher dimensions, there are more than a unique choice. The C-order ([row-major order](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-major_order)) and Fortran-order (column-major order) are two different conventions. Elements are stored row after row in the C-order, and column after column in the Fortran-order. This notion extends to arrays with more than two dimensions. For example, the matrix with [1, 2] on the first row and [3, 4] on the second row is stored internally as [1, 2, 3, 4] in C-order or [1, 3, 2, 4] in Fortran-order. Numpy uses the C-order, but that can be changed with some Numpy functions using the `order` keyword argument. Here, by default, the stride is (8, 4) (on a 32-bits system), since the first axis is the column, and the second is the row. 16-bit integers are used by default here."

Sometimes, however, you really need to open text files. In these cases, depending on the specific structure of your files, you may be able to write a faster function yourself. In the following example, the custom `loadtxt_fast` function (found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8956832/python-out-of-memory-on-large-csv-file-numpy)) is about twice as fast as `loadtxt`. Also, it creates less temporary objects and uses less memory. Another solution is to use the great Pandas library, which extends Numpy in different areas, notably for I/O functions which are generally faster and more efficient. This should probably be the subject of a future post."

    "This trick is a fun one. I once had a major performance issue in my code. I had a pretty good idea where it was, I can't remember the details but it was quite involved. After a thorough line-by-line profiling session however, I realized that I was completely wrong and that the bottleneck was actually the computation of the maximum element of an array. I was using `max(a)` instead of `a.max()`, thereby automatically converting the array into a list and using the built-in Python `max` function! Using Numpy's `max` function can be about 100 times faster. This is the kind of mistake you don't do twice."
